# About Me

Hi! New site. I decided to transition fully into the average ML trainer's blog to keep busy during training. I'm Mango or Delta-Vector on HF. I finetune models for https://dphn.ai and am always active (mostly) in Pygmalion.chat's Discord (and even trained some models for them!). I started out making Character Cards on Chub and then training 4Bs for function calling, and now I'm here... somehow. I don't question it too much. 

I train models primarily for ACR tasks, expanding into dealignment and RL to make sure the model doesn't spam "shivers down your spine." Currently, my favorite finetuned models are:

## Interests

I have so many hobbies it's kind of hard to keep track of. I think I've done alright for myself. Here's what I can remember:

- Writing: I used to write fanfics on Wattpad. Despite them being lost to time, they were very fun to write. Eventually I moved to writing Chub cards. I don't think they are the best thing ever, and a lot of them have massive oversights, but they were fun to make. My most popular card is somehow still on the first few pages on Chub. 
- Finetuning: I mean, there's not much to say here. I got $15 from my best friend to train a 4B function calling model, and then another friend let me run some small 8B trains on 2xRTX6000s, and it went uphill from there. I started out overfitting and underfitting Gemma-2-9B QLoRAs and then made my first, best release with Magnum-V2-4B and Holland-4B. I try to train models to be as uncensored and soulful as I can. 
- Hip-hop: TL;DR: Kalomaze (https://x.com/kalomaze) planted the bug of music in my ears. I used to barely listen to much music at all before he showed me the right and true path of Kanye West/JPEGMAFIA/Denzel Curry/and much more. 

## Background

I have no background in anything ML or tech. I haven't gone to college, but I passed high school! So I guess that counts for something. But I've got a decent amount of experience under my belt, I think:
- https://huggingface.co/CharGen/CharGen-v3-mini
	- Data cleaning for CharGen-V3 was me and Kubes toiling away at formatting Chub cards, and I managed to get it cleaned very fast and pretty well.
- https://huggingface.co/anthracite-org
	- I was a trainer for Anthracite Org, a prominent finetuning org of a bunch of friends. I trained anthracite-org/magnum-v4-27b, anthracite-org/magnum-v4-9b & anthracite-org/magnum-v2-4b.
- https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI
	- I trained all of the Quick models on the site as well as somehow getting my QwQ finetune hosted by them as a premium model. It does seem to have worked, Tav says users have not put out hit lists against me thus far. Great success! Also, the people there are very cool and nice.

	- Since a few months ago, I've started work for Dolphin AI. I enjoy their goal towards uncensored, de-aligned models, and I'm very happy to be working on it. Love them.
